visual-finance
==============

Visual-finance is a simple Node.js app that lets you view some financial info on a business, in a 'visual' way.

It uses Gearman to execute async jobs, Yahoo Finance provides the data and Scrapy is used to grab useful information. The data is then sent to the client via Web Sockets.
